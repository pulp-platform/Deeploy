Deeploy is an ONNX-to-C compiler that generates low-level optimized C Code for multi-cluster, heterogeneous SoCs. Its goal is to enable configurable deployment flows from a bottom-up compiler perspective, modeling target hardware in a fine-grained and modular manner.

Deeploy is developed as part of the PULP project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.
